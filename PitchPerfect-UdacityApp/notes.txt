----------------------------------------------
- Add images for buttons in PlayViewController.
- Create StackViews to contain buttons in PlaySoundsViewController.
    - Create VerticalStackView which takes up entire ViewController. This is done by setting autolayout
        constraints. Modify the constants in the constraints so that the StackView takes up the entire
        ViewContoller. Set the attributes for the StackView.

    - Add horizontal StackViews to the VerticalStackView. Set its attributes. Add buttons to these
        StackViews.
----------------------------------------------
- Implemented prepareForSegue. This allows us to trasfer the NSURL obj to the ViewController being transitioned to. (PlaySoundsViewController).

----------------------------------------------
- Make RecordSoundViewController a delegate of AVAudioRecorderDelegate.
    - Override audioRecorderDidFinishRecording. Add code so segue will be performed only after audio was successfully saved.
- Create a new ViewController class PlaySoundsViewController
    - Change the class name of the ViewController class to PlaySoundsViewController (what we just created)in the story board.
----------------------------------------------
- Add code to RecordViewController to record audio and related stop recording code. Both of these Actions are invoke from the buttons.
    -AVAudioRecorder is used to record audio
- Add UINavigationContoller, this implements a stack like structure to navigate through different viewcontrollers. Embed the current (record) View
Controller inside of a UINavigationContoller.
- add a new viewcontroller.
Drag a new VIewController to the right of the record view controller. select the element which should initiate the transition, the Stop button.
CNTRL + DRAG to the new ViewController. Finally select the Show segue from the popup menu.
- Rename the record view controller to RecordSoundViewController.
----------------------------------------------
- Add image asstets for buttons in Assets.xcassets. Link UIButtons to these images, remove text, fix auto layout issues, remove color backgrounds.
